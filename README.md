This project is all about making use of the basics of front-end web development. It includes jquery and google fonts at the time of writing this but very well may include more tools down the line.

## Universal Styles

There are stylesheets for each individual webpage, but there is also a style.css file which has styles that apply to all pages. Keep in mind that styles applied to the body inside the page specific stylesheet will override the style.css properties.

### Home Page

The landing page/home page for this project is the only page that does not contain a collapsable div. This was just a style choice although for consistency I may want to go back and add one at a later date but for now I'm content with the basic layout.

It would be nice to have a scroll effect eventually, or possibly put each link-card inside a carousel instead of having them all visible in a row.

Added a little secret link to the home page just for fun, not sure what will be inside of it I guess you'll just have to see for yourself.

## Project Carousel

This was the one feature that took the most research trial and error to achieve. Primary resource used to achieve this was css-tricks but google and stackoverflow were both massively helpful in troubleshooting styling issues.
