This project is all about making use of the basics of front-end web development. It includes jquery and google fonts at the time of writing this but very well may include more tools down the line.

## Home page

The landing page/home page for this project is the only page that does not contain a collapsable div. This was just a style choice although for consistency I may want to go back and add one at a later date but for now I'm content with the basic layout.

It would be nice to have a scroll effect eventually, or possibly put each link-card inside a carousel instead of having them all visible in a row.
